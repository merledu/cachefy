### Dependencies

#### JDK 8 or newer

We recommend LTS releases Java 8 and Java 11. You can install the JDK as recommended by your operating system, or use the prebuilt binaries from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).

#### SBT 

SBT is the most common built tool in the Scala community. You can download it [here](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html).  


### How to get started

Fork this repository on your own individual profiles. After forking clone the repository and run:

```sh
sbt test
```

You should see a whole bunch of output that ends with something like the following lines
```
[info] Tests: succeeded 1, failed 0, canceled 0, ignored 0, pending 0
[info] All tests passed.
[success] Total time: 5 s, completed Dec 16, 2020 12:18:44 PM
```
If you see the above then...
