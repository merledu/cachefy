#### SBT 

SBT is the most common built tool in the Scala community. You can download it [here](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html).  


### How to get started

Fork this repository on your own individual profiles. After forking clone the repository and run:

```sh

[info] All tests passed.
[success] Total time: 5 s, completed Dec 16, 2020 12:18:44 PM
